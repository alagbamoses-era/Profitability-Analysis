This project analyzes the datasets ((PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv))  to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


This project also analyses datasets of a  rural town that modernized its vote counting process.

* You will be give a set of poll data [PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
